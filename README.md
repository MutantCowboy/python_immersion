# Python Data Science Immersion Course

This is a course focusing on Python for data science. There are 5 initial sections intended to progress students from zero Python experience to an intermediate level of data analysis:

1. [Introduction to Python Programming Language - Part 1](notebooks/Python_01_Introduction.ipynb)
2. [Introduction to Python Programming Language - Part 2](notebooks/Python_02_Introduction.ipynb)
3. [Data Collection - Part 3](notebooks/Python_03_Data_Collection.ipynb)
4. [Data Analysis - Part 4](notebooks/Python_04_Analysis.ipynb)
5. [Data Visualization - Part 5](notebooks/Python_05_Visualization.ipynb)

Following sections will focus on machine learning and advanced data topics.

This is a collaborative learning process; everyone in attendance will learn a topic together.
